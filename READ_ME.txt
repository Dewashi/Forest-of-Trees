example terminal input:
forest_of_trees_simulation <test0.tsv 100

-the first input is a tsv file specifying tree co-ordinates, radius and the amount of water it needs to live

-the second input is a specified amount of rainfall over the trees being plotted. This enables a simulation
to be created showing which trees would survive in the case of limited rainfall.
